I received B.S. degree in Information Communication and Electronics Engineering from The Catholic University of Korea `(CUK)` in 2022.
I received M.S. degree in Department of Electrical Engineering from Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology `(UNIST)`, Korea in 2024.
I'm currently working toward the Ph. D. degree with the [SIC-X Lab.](https://sic-x.kaist.ac.kr/) under the supervision of Prof. Jinseok Choi from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology `(KAIST)`.
My current research interests include massive MIMO, full-duplex systems, and cell-free frameworks.
I also run a [blog](https://seunghy.tistory.com/).
It summarizes not only the theories and papers I have studied previously, but also encompasses all the content I'm currently studying.
For additional information on my research topic, please visit my blog.
