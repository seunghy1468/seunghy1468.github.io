		<p>I received B.S. in Information Communication and Electronics Engineering at The Catholic University of Korea in 2022. 
		Currently, I am pursuing Electrical Engineering at UNIST from 2022 to 2023.
		I'm a member of <a href="https://sic-x.kaist.ac.kr/">SIC-X Laboratory</a> under the supervision of Professor Jinseok Choi at KAIST. 
		My primary research interest is wireless communications.</p>
		<p>I also run a <a href="https://seunghy.tistory.com/">blog</a>.
		It summarizes not only the theories and papers I have studied previously, but also encompasses all the content I am currently studying.
